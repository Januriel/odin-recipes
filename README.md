# odin-recipes
First project @ odin: HTML
As of 2/3/23, odin-recipes is a html project that will be showcasing basic HTML skills such as setting up HTML framework, inserting links and images, and the use of enhancing texts with bold and italicise. The following logs will serve as Janu's progress tracker:

log 11/3/23: All four recipe pages have been completed. Will add index links next time. Thinking about adding image alt texts.

log 15/3/23: Completed framework of all pages on site. Added about.html for extra information. All images in recipe pages have alt text added.

log 31/3/23: Webpages have CSS added to them.

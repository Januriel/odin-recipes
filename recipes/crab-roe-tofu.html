        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><em>A dish with a tender mouthfeel. Crab roe is stir-fried till the oil within oozes out before being added to boiled tofu and accented with broth. Simple, yes, but gloriously fresh.</em></p>

        <h3>Ingredients (1 serving):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 box soft tofu (abt 700g), cubed</li>
            <li>300g homemade crab roe powder</li>
            <li>10g chives, chopped finely</li>
            <li>5g salt</li>
            <li>5g cornstarch</li>
            <li>30g lard</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix cornstarch and water to form slurry. Melt lard in the heated pan before adding the crab roe powder. Mix until fragrant. Add tofu, salt and about 200 ml water to the pan.</li>
            <li>Cook on medium heat for 6 - 8 minutes to let tofu absorb the flavour of crab roe.</li>

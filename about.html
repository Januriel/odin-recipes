        <h2><u>About</u></h2>
        <h4>Why “Food of Teyvat”?</h4>
        <p>For those who don’t know, Teyvat is the name of the world in the game Genshin Impact. As someone who plays Genshin Impact semi-religiously (and have gotten quite obsessed with collecting recipes and dishes in-game), I decided that I must flaunt my love for genshin food here by featuring them on site.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Fun Facts:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>All recipes featured on “Food of Teyvat” are picked using the Genshin Impact Wiki as reference and a number generator.</li>
            <li>Coincidentally, the 4 recipes are respectively from Mondstadt, Inazuma, Liyue and Sumeru, the four playable nations of Genshin Impact as of March 2023.</li>
        </ul>
